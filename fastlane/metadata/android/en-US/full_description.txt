This app allows you to quickly log activities on the <a href="https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy">Open-Source website Baby Buddy (https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy)</a>. You need to host your own Baby Buddy server to use the app. 

With the app you can log events with fewer button-presses than when using the web interface: Quickly track your baby's feedings, sleep phases, tummy-time sessions, and diaper changes and use the history for an easy overview of the latest events.  

The app is optimized to be used by multiple people on multiple devices so that event tracking can be shared among different caregivers.
