# Baby Buddy for Android documentation

The application will only work, if used in combintation with an running
[Baby Buddy Server](https://docs.baby-buddy.net/). If you do not have
a running baby buddy server instance, the application cannot work.

If you want to setup a Baby Buddy server, Baby Vuddy provides a [simple
install service that can be run through Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/cdubz/babybuddy).
